    The <em>iMac G3</em>is a line of Macintosh personal computers that Apple produced while Steve Jobs served as interim CEO and cofounder of the financially challenged business. The<em>iMac</em> was first introduced as the iMac. 

    Apple's <em>iMac</em> was a major success, rejuvenating the business and influencing the product designs of rivals. It contributed to the move away from antiquated technology like the Apple Desktop Bus, serial ports, and floppy disks in favor of the Universal Serial Bus.When Steve Jobs took over as Apple's interim CEO in 1997, the company's extensive product lines were immediately cut. The<em>iMac's</em> direct predecessor, the Power Macintosh G3 All-In-One, was one of the four Power Macintosh G3 models that Apple reduced from ten unique desktop <em>Mac</em>models to make room for them toward the end of the year. Apple wanted to find a substitute for the Performa's price point after discontinuing the consumer-oriented Performa series. On May 6, 1998[1], the firm unveiled the iMac, and on August 15, 1998, it started distributing the <em>iMac G3</em>.A more modern design was produced by a much later hardware update. A slot-loading optical drive, FireWire, "fanless" operation (via free convection cooling), a slightly modified form, and the choice of AirPort wireless networking were all included in this second-generation <em>iMac</em>. Until March 2003, Apple continued to sell this kind of ,<em>iMac</em>, mostly to those who required the ability to run Mac OS 9. Support for dial-up, Ethernet, wireless networking (using 802.11b and Bluetooth), USB, and FireWire rapidly became features that were present in every Apple product.
